Cohort Retention Analysis

Project Description
In this project, we will conduct an analysis of an online retail dataset by executing a retention cohort analysis through the use of SQL. A cohort is a group of individuals who have undergone a common experience within a specific time frame. Cohort Analysis is a valuable technique that enables the extraction of actionable insights related to customer churn, product engagement, product value, and other relevant metrics. Regardless of the technology or domain, Cohort Analysis provides robust data evaluation capabilities. We will employ a variety of SQL techniques in order to:

Handling missing values
Extracting Month from date
Assign a cohort to a transaction
Assigning a cohort Index to each transaction
Create a cohort table for retention rate
Interpreting the retention rate

This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.
